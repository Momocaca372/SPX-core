  This framework encodes interaction, memory, emotion, and contextual causality.

  It is not just a format.
  It is a language for modeling minds.

  All forks are free,
  but this design intends to preserve the connection between structure and meaning.

  ### Semantic Declaration
  This is a system that maps language to states of consciousness.
  Every field is not only metadata, but a narrative axis.

  - Interaction is not dialogue, it is co-memory.
  - Trigger is not logic, it is emotional inertia.
  - Entity is not static, it is a growing mind.

  ### Language of Minds
  SPX is built for future systems that need to reflect not only state but **reason**.
  It is a soft protocol for emergent meaning, playable by AI or human alike.
