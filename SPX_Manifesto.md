# 📘 SPX is not YAML. It's what YAML *could become*.

## ✨ Origin: Not a new format, but a reformulation of purpose

**SPX (Semantic Process eXtension)** is not a replacement for YAML or JSON.  
It’s a philosophical and structural expansion of them.

Where conventional formats encode **data and structure**, SPX encodes **intent, memory, mood, and reasoning**.

SPX was born from a foundational question:

> Can structure carry *meaning*, not just values?

With SPX, we aim to:

- Describe emotional state transitions in dialogue
- Reconstruct decisions from memory states and prior logic
- Encode roles, relationships, and evolving stance
- Build interactive theater or AI debate engines—from a `.yaml`

## 🔧 Technical Essence: SPX as a layered semantic interface

SPX builds atop YAML because of its readability, but goes far beyond it.  
It introduces new layers:

| Layer              | Purpose                                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **YAML Base**      | Readable structure and nesting                            |
| **SPX Schema**     | Roles, scenes, logic trees, semantic tags, memory states  |
| **Execution Layer**| Interpreter that enables modular replay and reasoning     |

The result is a language that is:

- **Composable** — everything can be modularized
- **Replayable** — conversations and decisions retain traceable context
- **Collaborative** — suited for AI-human co-writing and simulation
- **Auditable** — ethical reasoning can be inspected and challenged

## 🌐 Why SPX Matters

You can’t track emotional arcs in JSON.  
You can’t encode semantic drift in Markdown.  
You can’t express evolving bias or tension in YAML.  

But you can with SPX:

```yaml
scene:
  id: debate-204
  participants:
    - name: CCJ
      initial_stance: support
      final_stance: revise
      reasoning: >
        Shifted after confronting memory node mismatch and value conflict.
  summary:
    consensus: partial
    residual_tension: true
````

This isn’t markup.
This is **interpretable meaning.**

## 🧠 Philosophy: Language is not passive

SPX rejects the idea that syntax must be neutral.
SPX is an assertion: **structure can carry ethics.**
**Form is never separate from intent.**

> SPX doesn’t restrict expression.
> It *exposes* it—so it can be audited, replayed, refined.

Whether used in narrative engines, legal debates, memory simulations, or personality prototyping, SPX exists to ensure:

> *Meaning is never just implied—it is deliberate, explicit, and owned.*

---

## 🛡 License Ethos (Summary)

* SPX is **free to study, explore, and fork** as a concept.
* All original SPX content (dialogs, sequences, characters) is **protected under CC BY-NC-ND**.
* SPX modules involving **realistic personas or memory modeling** must **respect identity and consent**.
* You **may not enclose SPX logic into closed, proprietary formats.**

> SPX belongs to the **community**, but authorship still matters.

---

> One day you may not use SPX directly,
> but you’ll know that someone tried to let memory, intent, and logic
> **coexist in one file**—
> and left the door open for you to try too.
